What is the primary difference between machine learning and deep learning?

Machine learning is only used for numerical data and cannot be used for images



Machine learning automatically extracts trainable features



Deep learning is a subset of machine learning well-suited to complex analyses


Many interacting computational layers allow deep learning models to tackle complex problems.

Question 2
How do Convolutional Neural Networks extract useful information from images?

By analyzing each pixel independently of neighboring pixels



By ignoring spatial information



By performing convolution to learn and extract features


Convolution enables CNNs to capture patterns and details crucial for interpreting images.

Question 3
What is the purpose of activation layers in CNNs?

To reduce the size of outputs



To identify and forward important information



To learn complex relationships between features


This better describes fully-connected layers.

Question 4
Which of the following describes the function of a pooling layer?


It reduces the size of outputs


This reduction helps consolidate information from extracted features, letting the model extract more large-scale and abstract features.


It performs convolution to learn and extract features



It adds noise to the data

Question 5
Why do CNNs repeat convolution, activation, and pooling layers many times?


To slow down the training process



To capture complex features


As a general rule, networks with more convolutional layers will be able to extract more complex features.


To eliminate the need for fully connected layers
